                <h4 class="pad1">Visual Art will always be my first love no matter what. I started drawing/painting at 9 trying to compete with my brother because won a art competition drawing Martin Luther King and I basically told myself I could do that and have been learning different art styles ever since. My plan as a side business is to open my self-made website for people to buy work/designs. Here are a few images of work that I have completed its not to recent because I've of course gotten better lol.
